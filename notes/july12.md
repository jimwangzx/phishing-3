**Notes on the paper**
## School of Phish
- send out actual emails in controlled single or multiple settings

### Anti Phishing Phil
- [Screenshots of the game](https://www.mobygames.com/game/browser/anti-phishing-phil/screenshots/gameShotId,345798/)
- a game with fishes that shows whether they are real or scam (just links are available)
- this game was effective in both laboratory and real world settings

**Thoughts**
- can be used to compare performance
- different to what we are trying to do


## Lessons From a Real World Evaluation of Anti-Phishing Training
- used the same tools and methodology from school of Phish and validated their result
- setting: An office in portugal

## What.hack
- 5 levels 6 emails in 80 secs
- gamplay:
  - penalise some time if ask the IT help desk
  - too many wrong judgement gets you fired
