## Phishing Attacks Analysis
This file contains our initial approach and thought process behind the project. None of the ideas are concrete for now and will change on further discussion.

### Research Question
What do want to answer from this project?
- [ ] Does having an interactive video application provide better learning experience for users?
- [ ] Does certain age group perform better on videos and applications?
- [ ] Is it better to have the application targeted to certain group? Is it an easier experience to create targeted application for each group?
- [ ] **Detailed analysis on what type of phishing attack most people fall for**
  - This can include different age group
  - numerical stats on who fell for what kind of attack based on training application (not the quiz)
  - This behaviour can be programmed into the app to understand a detail of what kind of examples are causing people to be confused

### How to evaluate the application performance?
- [ ] General quiz to evaluate people on video vs quiz
- [ ] A before quiz and after quiz
- [ ] Quiz for different age group
- [ ] Detailed analysis for different kind of attacks (will have to do more research on if this is already present)
