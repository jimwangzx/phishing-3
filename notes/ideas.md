## Some ideas that I think can be used in the game

- [ ] have a login screen (probably facebook) and notify them saying that you should not have done that
- [ ] Have different emails and work on seeing if they are valid emails
- [ ] have at least one example of each phising type (maybe sub class the if necessary)


## Phishing Techniques
- Email Phishing
- HTTPS (provide https links to show its legit)
- Spear Phishing (targeted to small group with real name, job functions)
- Whaling/CEO fraud
  - Malicious actors use social media or the corporate website to find the name of the organization’s CEO or another senior leadership member. They then impersonate that person using a similar email address. The email might ask for a money transfer or request that the recipient review a document.
- Vishing
  - Voice phishing, or “vishing,” happens when a cybercriminal calls a phone number and creates a heightened sense of urgency that makes a person take an action against their best interests.
- Smishing (SMS)
- Angler Phising (DIrect messaging or notifications in social media)
- Pharming
  - We might ignore this as it is hard to detect as an end user
  - Hijack DNS and change the IP address
- Pop up phising
  - The newer version of pop-up phishing uses the web browser's "notifications" feature.
- Clone Phishing
  - many organizations use DocuSign to send and receive electronic contracts, so malicious actors might create fake emails for this service.
