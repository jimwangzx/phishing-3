**1. Overpayment scams/ Made a payment scam/ Payment notification**
- This is when an individual scammer making a purchase from a vendor overpays for the product or service and asks to be reimbursed for the overpayment but with the money sent to a different account. The account they made the purchase with is likely stolen, whereas the other account is the one they will profit from.
